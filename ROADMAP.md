# Rodmap for icenetwork.org

These are some ideas I am ruminating on



## Behavior Driven Development

* outline scenarios
* define features
* find out why I keep getting this error
```
  1) "before all" hook

  0 passing (1ms)
  1 failing

  1)  "before all" hook:
     TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of undefined
      at Function.handle (node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:140:27)
      at Object.router [as proposals] (node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:46:12)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index.js:22:43)
```



## Gulp Build

* (done) model it after the recipe from the ConFusion project
* find out why gulp watcher doesn't trigger new build after update in test/*.js
* configure bulp build to (re)launch express server after each build




## Proposal Form





## Planning Committee form
